# what is `b`?

I got bored during 4th of July weekend, so a mini hackathon to put something together.

In short:

1. file hosting, and
2. link shoterning, and
3. pastebin

Project is inspired by [https://github.com/raftario/filite](https://github.com/raftario/filite). Actually, `index.html` is adopted from `filite`, because I'm too lazy to write a frontend.
